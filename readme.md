# 19 Days in Japan

A free WordPress theme that makes any travel blog instantly shine. Each day is a new experience with full screen hero images, big and clear typography, and a minimalist approach that highlights your content, whether it's writing or photography.

This theme was initially created for http://19daysinjapan.com/ and is distributed as is.

The code has been cleaned up a little, though we were running against the clock at the time, so it might need some additional cleaning/tweaking. Feel free to open any issues with suggestions or problems you may been having — I'll fix them whenever I've got some free time.

Arigatou!
